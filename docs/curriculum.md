## **⚡ Phase 2: Advanced JavaScript**
### **Module 8: Asynchronous JavaScript**
- Callbacks and callback hell  
- Promises (`.then`, `.catch`, `.finally`)  
- `async/await` and error handling  
- Fetch API and making HTTP requests  

📝 **Mini-Project:** Fetch data from an API and display it on a webpage  

---

### **Module 9: Debugging & Error Handling**
